# Twilio Rusk SDK/Helper Library

This is a small crate that is, in time, intended to simplify working with Twilio's APIs.
At the moment, it's just a collection of structs that I've been using, that help me to deserialise API responses, whether successful or unsuccessful.
However, the plan is to build on it and flesh it out into a full helper library/sdk.

## Usage

You can install twilio-rust using [Cargo][cargo] with the following command:

```bash
cargo add twilio-rust
```

Alternatively, add the following line to your *Cargo.toml*:

```toml
twilio-rust = "0.1.0"
```
